\section*{Introduction}

For this assignment we were supposed to create an ordered list and an ordered tree and then compare the insertion times between these structures.

\section{List}

So for the list implementation, 2 functions were used. The first one called $list\_new$ simply creates an empty list. The other one called $list\_insert$ is a recursive function that's divided up into three smaller parts. The first one inserts the argument(element) if the list is empty, the second one inserts the argument(element) at the beginning of the list if the argument is smaller than the current head, because then we know that this element is the smallest one. The third part is run if the first two previous parts isn't run. This part recursively compare the element we want to insert with the elements in the last. It goes from head to tail, and compares until it finds it's spot and then completes the list again.

\begin{minted}{elixir}
 def list_new() do [] end

 def list_insert(e, []) do [e] end
 def list_insert(e, [h|t]) when e <= h do [e,h|t] end
 def list_insert(e, [h|t]) do [h|list_insert(e, t)] end
\end{minted}


\section{Tree}

For the tree implementation also 2 functions were used. The first one works similarly to the list one and is called $tree\_new$. The second function is split into multiple parts. The first three parts can be seen as base cases. Which are called upon if the tree is empty, or if there's only one current node(head) in the tree, then we will insert the new node(e) into the tree and make the current node(head) in the tree a "leaf" to the new node(e) or IF the new node(e) is smaller then the current node(head)
If the tree is of a bigger scale than 0 or 1 nodes, then the two later parts will be executed, here we recursively move through the tree and compare our new node(e) with the rest of the nodes in the tree. 

\begin{minted}{elixir}
def tree_new() do :nil end

def tree_insert(e, :nil) do {:leaf, e} end

def tree_insert(e, {:leaf, head}=right) when e < head do 
    {:node, e, :nil, right} end

def tree_insert(e, {:leaf, _}=left)  do 
    {:node, e, left, :nil} end
    
def tree_insert(e, {:node, head, left, right}) when e < head do 
    {:node, head, tree_insert(e, left), right} end
    
def tree_insert(e, {:node, head, left, right}) do
    {:node, head, left, tree_insert(e, right)} end
\end{minted}

\section{Bench}

The following functions were used for testing the insertion time of the data structures. The same list of elements were used for both data structures.

\begin{minted}{elixir}
def bench() do bench(100) end

def bench(l) do

    ls = [16,32,64,128,256,512,1024,2*1024,4*1024,8*1024]
    
    time = fn (i, f) ->
      seq = Enum.map(1..i, fn(_) -> :rand.uniform(100000) end)
      elem(:timer.tc(fn () -> loop(l, fn -> f.(seq) end) end),0)
    end

    bench = fn (i) ->

      list = fn (seq) ->
        List.foldr(seq, list_new(), fn (e, acc) -> list_insert(e, acc) end)
      end
    
      tree = fn (seq) ->
        List.foldr(seq, tree_new(), fn (e, acc) -> tree_insert(e, acc) end)
      end
    
      tl = time.(i, list)
      tt = time.(i, tree)
    
      IO.write("  #{tl}\t\t\t#{tt}\n")
    end

    IO.write("# benchmark of lists and tree (loop: #{l}) \n")
    Enum.map(ls, bench)

    :ok
end

def loop(0,_) do :ok end
    def loop(n, f) do
    f.()
    loop(n-1, f)
end
\end{minted}
